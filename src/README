RTT and RTO
-------------

I changed the existing functions provided by Stevens in his rtt.c file to use integral operations. 
I also changed his code to deal exclusively in milliseconds. 

RELIABILITY
------------

I exactly copied TCP Reno's methods. I used a sliding sender window for unacked segments, cumulative acks, and fast retransmit for triple duplicate acks.


FLOW CONTROL / CONGESTION CONTROL
---------------------------------------------

Slow start is implemented- exponential growth until ssthresh, linear after.
The sender/server cannot send more than min(receive_window, congestion_window, sender_window) at a time. 
If there is a timeout then cwnd is set to 1, exponential growth to ssthresh (1/2 cwnd) and linear after.
If there is a triple duplicate ack then cwnd is cut in half, ssthresh is set to cwnd, and linear growth. 
A persistent driving timer is used to query the client at intervals that double as per the RTO calculation. 
	The initial timeout value is set to the RTO at the time that the persistent timer starts.
